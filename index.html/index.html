                <h3>REALIZATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
                <P>After synthesizing our research we uncovered a new insight; that users often would like to take on these repair projects themselves. Because of a lack of knowledge about an approachable process and/or physical strength limitations, we realized these users were seeking a proactive solution to DIY home repairs tailored to their physical limitations. We asked ourselves how might we create a resource of information and tips centered on the abilities and alternate approaches of smaller body types to empower people to approach and tackle a home repair project on their own.
